          <p>
            This assignment was to create a short video that tells a story without the use of any words. The video had to be recorded on a
            mobile phone. We had to work in a small group.

          <h5>Task</h5>
          <p>
            This assignment was a group project. We had to create three videos for Cherry Pop and present them on a responsive pretotype
            website aimed at the teachers of young teenagers and their parents, which will promote the Cherry Pop app.

        <h4>Solution</h4>
        <h3>Jamboard</h3>
        <p>
          This was the very first step of the process, where we had a brainstorming session on Google Jamboard, and then everyone had the
          opportunity to vote on the idea they liked with circles.

        <h3>Treatment</h3>
        <p>
          We wrote a treatment to describe what our story is about. So everyone in our team knew all the details before we started filming.

        <h3>Storyboard and narrative curve</h3>
        <p>
          Here you can see the storyboard that demonstrates all the scenes in our video and describes shots, sounds, camera movements and
          surroundings.

        <h3>Video Production</h3>
        <p>
          I was responsible for shooting and editing the video. I used a GoPro camera for filming, Adobe Premier Pro for editing, and Adobe
          Audition for audio improvement.

        <h3>Website pretotype</h3>
        <p>
          We all made initial sketches that helped us decide on the design. On the left you can see the final sketch, in the middle is our
          XD prototype, and on the right is our video in an Instagram post with a 1x1 frame.
